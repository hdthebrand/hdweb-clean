## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light-blue (#94B49F) to convey a sense of calm, and trustworthiness, with a slightly desaturated, understated presence. This decision takes into account the fact that 'tool' websites are generally trusted for providing useful services. This color has balanced brightness, making it effective for backgrounds and text.
- Background color: Very light-blue (#F0F4EF), with a small amount of color. Note this color is closely matched in hue to the primary color. Its desaturation and lightness are very high.
- Accent color: Green-blue (#5F8473) with increased saturation and darkness compared to primary, for a balance between calmness and gentle emphasis on the important details.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, for a modern, machined, objective look. 'Inter' will be used throughout, because the app features short explanations or labels for the features offered, not longer running bodies of text.
